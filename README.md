#### My bash configuration and settings files

* .bash_profile
* .bashrc
* .profile

note: You will not see the above files in the Mac OS X Finder, as they are invisible since they are preceded with a dot.  Use the Terminal with something like `ls -la` and you will see the files, leading dot files, config files, and .DS_Store files.

Since these are changed somewhat often it may be wise to symblink them to my git directories.  Then I make edits and they are in my git local directory, I just have to remember to add and sync.  I have added a reminder to ask the git masters what the status on this notion is, and will post it as a bug until I find and answer.

I also asked on stack overflow, where you can [read the answer here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26519144/what-is-the-best-workflow-for-rapidly-changing-files). … and that is why I dislike Stack and their entire system, people get booted for the sake of ***order***, fuck order… questions need answers — if they are in the wrong category then ***your*** system is broken, as it should put them into the correct category.  I have a feeling this is a problem that is more beauroratic than a bug that can be fixed, but it is still an improvement over the terribly spammy experts exchange that dominated the text Q & A market a few years back.

I will update this git repo to reflect what I have figured out as soon as I figure it all out.
