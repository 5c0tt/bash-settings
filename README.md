#### My bash configuration and settings files

* .bash_profile
* .bashrc
* .profile

note: You will not see the above files in the Mac OS X Finder, as they are invisible since they are preceded with a dot.  Use the Terminal with something like `ls -la` and you will see the files, leading dot files, config files, and .DS_Store files.

Since these are changed somewhat often it may be wise to symblink them to my git directories.  Then I make edits and they are in my git local directory, I just have to remember to add and sync.  I have added a reminder to ask the git masters what the status on this notion is, and will post it as a bug until I find and answer.

I also asked on stack overflow, where you can [read the answer here.(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26519144/what-is-the-best-workflow-for-rapidly-changing-files) â€¦ and that is why I hate Stack and their entire system, people get booted for the sake of order, fuck order, we have questions, we need answers, if they are in the wrong category your system is broken, as it should put them into the correct category.  but that is what happens when you have a largely moderated by users system.  You get super nerds that will do whatever they can to enforce the rules.  They act like major ballers but in reality they are pesky little yes men to the founders of the company.  But they have fake power, or real power to make a user not get what they came to the site for, thereby being a detriment to the site in general.

</end soapbox>

I will update this git repo to reflect what I have figured out as soon as I figure it all out.
