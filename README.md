#### My bash configuration and settings files

* .bash_profile
* .bashrc
* .profile

note: You will not see the above files in the Mac OS X Finder, as they are invisible since they are preceded with a dot.  Use the Terminal and you will see them.

I think that since these are changes somewhat often it may be wise to symblink them to my git directories.  Then I make edits and they are in my git local directory, I just have to remember to add and sync.  I have added a reminder to ask the git masters what the status on this notion is, and will post it as a bug until I find and answer.
